##### DISCLAIMER: Use of cursing language:: (It's 2021, better write disclaimer... Am I Right?) 

Lmao, this was a school project. never finished and probably never gonna finish it. 
Was meant to be a "Social Management" kind of app where you could check insights and manage your posting one all the most popular socialMedia. 

##### Problems 
Problem of similar projects? - 
  * COST of servers. All the APIs has to work on a server and server costs money :| 
  * Shit rules against privacy
  * (Similar to the second point) Fuck Facebook. APIs are shit AF
  * Market already full of these kind of Apps. Not worth creating one even if you have innovative ideas. 
  
##### Summarize
